# Level Design & Progression

## Checkpoint & Progression System
- Each sector of the **lab is structured as a self-contained puzzle zone**.
- **Security tightens** over time: more cameras, locked doors, and enhanced NPC AI.
- NPC roles expand—higher-level staff grant access to deeper facility levels.

## Example Level Flowchart
1. **Awakening in Containment Cell** – Learning movement and exploration.
2. **Escaping the First Room** – Crawling through vents or taking over an NPC.
3. **Navigating Security Zones** – Using the right disguises to avoid suspicion.
4. **Unlocking New Abilities** – Upgrading possession range, hacking, and disguise tactics.
5. **Final Escape Attempt** – Choosing between escape or altering the lab’s fate.
