# Concept Document - Alien Slime: The Great Escape

Concept Document for the Project "Alien Slime: The Great Escape"





1. Basic Game Information



1.1. Brief Game Description



"Alien Slime: The Great Escape" is a sci-fi stealth puzzle game with action elements, where the player controls a kind-hearted but vulnerable alien slime attempting to escape from a classified laboratory. Using the ability to "possess" NPCs (guards, scientists, engineers), you gain access to keycards, passwords, and unique skills. However, at the right moment, you must "become yourself" again, crawl through ventilation shafts, or find a suitable NPC for a new "possession."



1.2. Core Game Concepts



1. Stealth and "Slime Form"



The alien’s slime form is weak but highly flexible. You can crawl through tight spaces (ventilation shafts, under furniture) and avoid security cameras.


Visibility mechanics: If the slime stays in sight for too long, guards may notice and capture it.


If discovered, the level restarts from the last "safe" checkpoint.


2. "Possession" Mechanic



To "possess" an NPC, you must sneak up unnoticed (NPCs should not be chasing you or in an alert state).


The act of possession requires holding a button for a certain time. If you are noticed, the process is interrupted, and an alarm sounds.


Once inside an NPC, you gain full access to their functions: inventory, keycards, computer access, etc.







3. Switching Between Forms



In NPC bodies, you can walk freely, interact with equipment, and blend in.


However, sometimes you must leave the host body and return to slime form to crawl through ventilation or reach new areas.


Some situations force you to abandon a host (e.g., locked doors that can only be opened from the inside, or deadly traps impassable by humans).





4. Puzzles and Environment



Each NPC may have a unique item or ability:

Guard’s Keycard – grants access to specific zones.


SWAT’s Thermal Vision – detects hidden paths or anomalies.


Engineer’s Toolkit – repairs damaged panels and disables alarms.

Players must explore locations (offices, laboratories, storage rooms), gather clues, eavesdrop on conversations, and find alternative paths.




5. Consequences of Mistakes



If spotted in slime form or acting suspiciously in an NPC body, an alarm is triggered.


A high alert level means security captures you and returns you to your containment chamber → level restart (or checkpoint respawn).


The game saves progress between levels, so unlocked areas remain accessible.





















1.3. Target Audience



Age: Approximately 12+ or 16+, depending on how dark the laboratory experiments are depicted.

Gaming Preferences:

Fans of stealth and puzzle games (mid-core audience).


Sci-fi enthusiasts who enjoy secret experiments and hidden research.


Players who like mechanics involving "shape-shifting" or "controlling different characters" (but here, it's done through mind control).


Those who prefer minimal violence: the alien does not want to kill anyone—only to escape.



1.4. References and Inspirations



1.  (Phobia Game Studio, 2020)


What we plan to borrow:

Different: Greater focus on sci-fi aesthetics and stealth-puzzle mechanics rather than platforming.



2. The Game World



2.1. The Protagonist



2.1.1 Short, monosyllabic character description


Name: Tentatively "Blu" (or any other slime-themed name). Could remain an unnamed alien, but "Blu" is used for convenience.

Backstory: Blu is a slime-like alien organism that accidentally ended up on Earth (possibly due to a crashed ship or abduction from its home planet).

Motivation: A strong desire for freedom and returning home.

Strengths:

Can change shape, slip through narrow gaps.


Ability to "possess" human minds (or other beings).


Cute and harmless appearance, making it easy for players to empathize.

Weaknesses:

Vulnerable in direct confrontations (physically weak without a "host" body).


Unable to communicate directly (no human speech in slime form).


Dependent on other creatures to overcome obstacles.

2.1.2 What is the Protagonist’s Goal and Motivation?



Goal: Escape from the secret research laboratory (and possibly find a way back to its home planet).

Motivation: A deep desire for freedom and escape from constant experimentation. The protagonist does not wish to harm anyone—it simply wants to flee from danger.

Why should the player care?

The player will empathize with a kind-hearted creature that is being held against its will.


The gradual unveiling of the "human side" of the lab staff, and the choice of whether (or how) to oppose them, introduces moral dilemmas.


The escape atmosphere and the need for creative problem-solving (using slime-based abilities) make for an engaging gameplay experience.





2.2. The Game World



2.2.1 Brief Description of the World



Location: The events take place in a classified scientific research facility on Earth, controlled by a high-tech corporation or a military organization.


Time Period: The near future or an alternate present (20XX), where technology allows for the containment and study of alien organisms.

Environmental Features:

The complex consists of laboratory chambers, containment cells, experiment halls, office spaces, and storage rooms, all designed in a semi-futuristic style.


The outside world is almost invisible to the player, as most of the story unfolds within this secured facility.





Inhabitants (Cultures/Races):

Humans (scientists, guards, military personnel).


Experimental organisms (other alien life forms, genetically modified animals).


The protagonist itself is a rare and valuable specimen for researchers.



2.2.2 Why Will Players Enjoy Exploring This World?



Mysteries of the Laboratory: Each section of the facility holds scientific secrets, prototype devices, and dangerous experiments.


Blend of Sci-Fi and Stealth: Players will gradually uncover the nature of the research conducted here and witness the consequences of scientific discoveries (or failures).


Visual Variety: The contrast between sterile white corridors and deteriorated sections where failed experiments have led to destruction.


Moral Dilemmas: The player might find evidence of unethical research. They may start sympathizing not only with the protagonist but also with other victims of the experiments.





2.2.3 Games with a Similar Setting





 (Valve, 1998) — The Black Mesa research complex, alien experiments, and unexpected containment breaches.


 (Valve, 2007) — A highly technological testing facility with a confined and structured environment.


 (2017) — A space station filled with experimental technology, where the player gradually uncovers the deeper truth.



Although the genre differs (shooter, puzzle, immersive sim), the atmosphere of a scientific research base hiding alien secrets closely aligns with Alien Slime: The Great Escape.










2.3. Story



2.3.1 Conflicts



External Conflict:

The alien slime (Blu) vs. the scientists and military personnel who want to recapture it and continue their experiments.


Internal Conflict:

Blu does not want to harm anyone but is forced to hide and use its possession abilities. Can it trust certain people? How far is it willing to go for its freedom?


Systemic Conflict:

The laboratory is in crisis—security system failures, experimental lifeforms escaping, and facility-wide chaos. This makes escape both easier (due to confusion) and more dangerous (because of loose creatures).





2.3.2 Antagonists



Lead Scientist: A brilliant but ruthless researcher (professor or project coordinator) who sees Blu as nothing more than a specimen for study.


Military Security Forces:

They follow strict orders to contain or eliminate the alien.

Some may doubt the morality of their actions, but duty comes first.

(Potential) AI Security System:

A central computerized surveillance system that controls doors, turrets, and alarms.

It sees Blu as an "anomaly to be neutralized."















2.3.3 Key Story Events



Beginning:

A security system failure or sabotage allows Blu to break out of containment.

The player learns basic movement and slime mechanics.

Discovery of the Possession Ability:

The player successfully possesses an NPC for the first time.

This introduces a new stealth mechanic and shows how it helps bypass security.

Escalation:

Scientists and military personnel notice the escape.

The facility shifts to high alert, increasing patrols and lockdowns.

Other dangerous experimental creatures begin escaping as well.

Climax:

Blu reaches the central control system or the final exit.

A major confrontation occurs (either with the lead scientist, a cybernetic mutant, or security forces).

Final Outcome:

The player either escapes successfully (leading to an open-ended conclusion) or must make a critical decision about other captured lifeforms and the future of the laboratory.


3. Unique Features of the Project



3.1 Unique Mechanics


3.1.1 What Do They Add?

1. "Possession" Mechanic



Description: The alien slime (Blu) can temporarily leave its form and "possess" the body of an NPC (guard, scientist, engineer).






What It Adds:

Flexible Problem-Solving: Different "hosts" have unique inventories (keycards, weapons), knowledge (passwords), and abilities (repairs, system access).


Deep Stealth and Social Mimicry: The player must convincingly "act" as the possessed NPC to avoid suspicion.



2. Slime Form and "Stealth Crawling"


Description: Without a host body, Blu is very vulnerable but can crawl through vents, narrow gaps, and remain undetected.

What It Adds:

A unique stealth approach that differs from traditional "hiding behind cover."

Alternative routes—where a human cannot pass, the slime finds a way.





3. Suspicion System


Description: If the player behaves unnaturally in an NPC’s body (e.g., a guard wanders off route, a scientist waves a gun around), other characters may notice.

What It Adds:

Dynamic Tension: Players must monitor their host’s behavior and surroundings to avoid raising alarms.


Varied Playthroughs: Choose between cautious and patient play or take risks for faster progression.











3.1.2 How Will These Features Engage Players?

A Fresh Take on Stealth: Instead of being a "killer in the shadows," the player controls a harmless but intelligent slime that must use wit and disguise.


Multiple Solutions: Switching between forms and using NPC bodies creates varied level progression paths.


Emotional Connection to the Protagonist: Players will empathize with the trapped alien, strengthening their immersion in the escape story.



3.1.3 Will They Cause Frustration? What’s Their Purpose?



Possession:

Ethical Concern: Some players may feel uneasy about "mind control." However, the story justifies it as self-defense, and the game avoids graphic violence—Blu doesn’t harm its hosts.


Core Gameplay Purpose: Introduces innovative stealth mechanics and puzzle-solving while keeping the protagonist non-violent.

Slime Form:

Controlling a "sticky" organism may feel unusual, but movement is designed to be intuitive and smooth (climbing, sticking to surfaces, hiding).


Gameplay Purpose: Emphasizes Blu’s fragility and encourages stealth over brute force.


Suspicion System:

Adds tension in a good way, requiring the player to blend in with the NPC's role.


Gameplay Purpose: Enhances stealth depth and makes possession more immersive—NPCs won’t blindly ignore strange behavior.











3.1.4 References to Similar Mechanics in Other Games

 (mind control of enemies for puzzle-solving).


 (social stealth mechanics, blending in as NPCs).


 (crawling through ventilation to bypass obstacles—but here, Blu is non-violent).


3.2 Customization (If Present)

Character Customization:

Players may choose Blu’s slime color (blue, green, purple, etc.) and small cosmetic details (funny eyes, spots).


NPC customization is temporary—the player can briefly "dress up" possessed characters by changing their outfit (helmet, glasses), but this is purely for gameplay purposes.


Ability Customization:

Potential Upgrades:


Increase possession range.


Improve slime movement speed.


Expand "substance volume" (affects how long Blu can stay in slime form before needing a new host).


Progression Style:


Either linear (upgrades unlock automatically with the story) or modular mini-upgrades.


The current focus is on mechanics rather than deep skill trees to keep the game accessible and intuitive.




3.3 Multiplayer Modes (If Included)

For now, Alien Slime: The Great Escape is designed as a single-player experience focused on stealth, story, and unique possession mechanics.

However, potential future expansions could include:

Co-op Mode (Concept Idea): Two alien slimes with different abilities help each other escape. One specializes in possession, while the other has unique physical skills.


PvP Mode (Less Likely): A "Hunter vs. Alien" mode where one player controls a guard, and the other plays as Blu—but this would drastically alter the game’s core concept.

The primary goal is a strong single-player campaign with immersive mechanics and storytelling.





4. Gameplay Loop



4.1 Core Mechanics



Basic Controls


Slime Form:


The player controls a small alien slime, able to crawl through vents, hide in dark corners, and avoid direct combat.


In this form, Blu cannot attack (or does so in very limited ways) but has high mobility to evade enemies.


Blu can sneak up on NPCs and, by holding a button, possess them.



Possession Mechanic:

Once inside an NPC (scientist, guard, engineer), the player can:


Walk freely in restricted zones without suspicion (if behaving normally).


Use inventory (keycards, weapons, tools).


Access computers, terminals, or perform the NPC’s specific duties (e.g., a guard can order others to move away).


Suspicion Gauge:

Other NPCs may notice strange behavior (e.g., a scientist wandering into a restricted military area).


If suspicion reaches a critical level, an alarm is triggered.







Interaction with the Environment


Puzzles:

Locked doors requiring password entry or biometric scanning—must be accessed using the appropriate "host" NPC.


Laser/electric barriers, which can only be disabled via a control panel accessible to engineers.


Levers and buttons in hard-to-reach locations (ventilation shafts, elevated platforms) that only the slime form can reach.


Stealth Mechanics:

Had to abandon an NPC body? In slime form, you must hide from patrols by using furniture, dark corners, or ventilation shafts.


Visibility indicator shows when the slime is at risk of being detected.



Collecting Clues and Items:

Some rooms contain log disks, employee notes, and story fragments (password hints, lab history, classified documents).


Tools that enhance NPC abilities (e.g., "Enhanced Access Card" to open more doors, "Upgraded Scanner" to detect hidden security systems).

This system encourages players to explore, strategize, and use their environment creatively, ensuring multiple ways to overcome challenges.





4.2 Objectives and Progression



Primary Goal: Escape from the laboratory and ultimately gain freedom (or possibly reconnect with Blu’s home planet).

Sub-objectives in Each Level:

Story-driven:

Discover details about the lab's experiments.


Encounter key NPCs (some friendly, some hostile) who affect the story.

Exploration:

Unlock new areas (offices, research halls, storage rooms).


Find hidden passages using slime abilities.


Collect important items (codes, access cards).

Confrontation (Minimal but Present):

Avoid direct combat with hostile mutants.


Use weapons only when inside a guard’s body (or through automated defense systems).

Progress System:

Each successfully completed mission (e.g., "Disable the security system in Lab Block B") moves the story forward and opens new areas.


Solving puzzles earns useful upgrades (better keycards, security clearance, reduced alarm sensitivity).


The player gradually gets closer to freedom, while also uncovering the facility’s secrets.



4.3 Progression System



Level Design and Chapters:

The game is divided into multiple floors or sections of the laboratory.


Each chapter is a set of rooms/zones tied together by the story.


Difficulty increases gradually:


New security systems, smarter guards.

More alien test subjects escaping alongside Blu.


Unlocking Higher NPC Roles:

At first, Blu can only possess low-level guards.


Later, it can control higher-ranking officers with access to classified zones.

Scientists of different clearance levels provide lab access and research information.


Engineers can repair devices, disable robots, and open doors.


Achievements & Rewards:

Stealth-based: Completing a mission without triggering an alarm.


Narrative-based: Uncovering secret experiments, saving other alien test subjects.


Challenge-based: Avoid using weapons the entire game, trick a high-ranking officer.

As players progress, they become more skilled at using Blu’s abilities, finding creative ways to outsmart security and escape.

4.5.  (First Level Branching Paths)


Link to flowchart:













4.5.1 Level Start – Awakening Scene

Event: The slime awakens inside a locked containment chamber.

Gameplay:

Learn basic movement and interactions (finding ventilation ducts, weak spots in doors).


Result: The player prepares for the escape attempt (move to A).



4.5.2 Attempting to Escape the Containment Cell

The player learns stealth movement (crawling, hiding, avoiding cameras) and finds an exit (ventilation shaft or weak door panel).


Failure: If the guards detect the slime → mission restart from the beginning or latest checkpoint.


Success: The player reaches a maintenance corridor → Checkpoint 1 saves progress.



4.5.3 Encounter with a Scientist NPC (Introduction to the Possession Mechanic)

The player discovers that the next area is guarded or requires an authorized clearance pass.


Objective: Sneak up on the scientist and use "possession" for the first time.


Failure: If the scientist spots the slime (or security notices the takeover) → alarm triggers → checkpoint reload.


Success: The player takes control of the scientist → Checkpoint 2 saves progress.



4.5.4 Entering a Restricted Zone

Now in a scientist’s body, the player must:

Either use an access panel to open doors OR walk past guards without raising suspicion.


Stealth Behavior: NPC guards might greet the player or ask basic questions—if responses/actions seem suspicious, an alarm triggers.


Success: The player gains access to the next area.



4.5.5 Security Puzzle (Laser Traps & Barriers)

The player reaches an area blocked by security lasers or electric fields.


There are multiple solutions (branching paths):


Possess an engineer in the area to disable the security from a control panel.


Abandon the scientist’s body and crawl through an alternate ventilation route, manually shutting down power (e.g., pulling a fuse from a circuit box).


Failure: If the player is caught disabling the system, an alarm triggers → Checkpoint 3 reloads.


Success: The path forward is unlocked.





4.5.6 Final Corridor of the First Level

After disabling the security barrier, the player advances to the next sector of the facility.


A short cinematic scene may play:


A siren signals increased security measures.


Other test subjects (alien mutants) begin escaping, setting the stage for further chaos in later levels.


Result: The level ends, and the next chapter unlocks.
